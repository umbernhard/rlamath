# Risk-limiting audits from the ground up

This repo consists of a series of notebooks exploring the statistical underpinnings of risk-limiting audits. I start with fairly rudimentary structures and walk through developing enough statistical machinery to taclke the main types of RLAs. 


The notbooks are ordered:
1. [Permutation-based Audits](https://github.com/umbernhard/rlamath/blob/main/Permutation-based%20Audits.ipynb)
2. [Building on permutations](https://github.com/umbernhard/rlamath/blob/main/Building%20on%20permutations---the%20Central%20Limit%20Theorem.ipynb)
3. [Auditing elections with hypothesis testing](https://github.com/umbernhard/rlamath/blob/main/Auditing%20Elections%20with%20Hypothesis%20Tests.ipynb)

This is all still a work in progress, so things will be rough for a while. I'm not an expert in statisticsâ„¢, so a lot of this is me fumbling around in the dark to try to understand how it all works. In the event that that's useful to someone else, I hope this helps!
